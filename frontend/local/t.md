### Problem

Consider the sequence $\{a_n\}$ given by:
$$
a_n = \frac{n^2 + (-1)^n}{3n^2 + 2}.
$$

**Part A:** Determine whether the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is bounded. Justify your answer.

**Part B:** Show that $\{a_n\}$ is convergent, and find $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n$. 

**Part C:** Define a function $f(x) = \frac{x^2 + \cos(x)}{3x^2 + 2}$. Using the derivative rules (e.g., product, quotient, and chain rule), find where $f(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $(1, \infty)$. Hint: Consider first finding the critical points of $f'(x)$ and analyzing intervals. Explore the behavior of the sequence $\{a_n\}$ relative to uniform continuity to inform your analysis as $x \to \infty$.

Consider a sequence $(a_n)$ defined recursively by $a_1 = \alpha$ (where $\alpha > 0$) and $a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{1+a_n}$ for $n \geq 1$.

**Part A:** Calculate $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of $\alpha$.

**Part B:** Show that the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded and find its limit superior and limit inferior as $n \to \infty$.

**Part C:** Assume $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ and consider the sequence $f(a_n)$. Using the context of uniform continuity, prove that the sequence $f(a_n)$ converges to $f(L)$, where $L$ is the limit of the original sequence $(a_n)$.

**Twist:** All arguments should avoid evaluating limits directly with numerical computation. Use the properties of sequences, series, and convergence rules discussed in class.

**Problem Statement:**

Consider the sequence $(a_n)$ defined by $a_n = \frac{(-1)^n n^2}{n^2 + 1}$.

---

**Part A:** Show that the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded.

**Part B:** Prove that the sequence $(a_n)$ diverges. Use the definition of convergence and play against it using limit superior and limit inferior.

**Part C:** Define a function $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{x^2 + 1}$ and demonstrate that $f(x)$ is uniformly continuous on the set $[0, \infty)$ using the concept of derivatives. Then, utilizing the result of Part B, analyze the behavior of the function $f(x)$ as $x \to \infty$ to determine the eventual behavior of the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ by considering the convergence criteria.

**Twist:** You are not allowed to directly use calculation software or standard calculators to evaluate or simplify sequences or series. Only algebraic manipulations and logical proofs with variables such as $n$, $k$, or $\alpha$ are allowed.
